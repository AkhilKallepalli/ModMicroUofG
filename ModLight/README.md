Modular light (ModLight) sources can be integrated into complex systems for microscopy, medical imaging, remote sensing, and so many more. Motivated by the need for affordable and open access alternatives that are globally relevant, we have designed and shared light devices that use simple, off-the-shelf components. Red, green, blue, white and near-infrared LEDs are combined using mirrors and X-Cube prisms in novel devices. This modular nature allows portability and mounting flexibility. The ModLight suite can be used with any optical system that requires single- or multi-wavelength illumination such as bright-field and epifluorescence microscopes.
