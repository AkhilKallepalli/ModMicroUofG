# ModMicroUofG Epifluorescence Microscopy
The repository contains all the files, modifications and updates to the epifluorescence microscopy set up within our **Mod**ular **Micro**scopy (ModMicroUofG) project

The original project and microscope is adopted from the [OpenFlexure Project](https://openflexure.org/). Of the available modifications to the OpenFlexure microscope, we chose the [Delta Stage](https://openflexure.org/projects/deltastage/) version to modify as we are interested in reflection illumination and control over the filter combinations and light sources. 

In order to optimise the light sources and excitation wavelengths, we removed the excitation filters in the setup and replaced it with a modular, in-house designed light source for wavelength control. Consequently, our modified filter setup allows multiple excitation-dichroic-emission filters combinations for modular imaging.
