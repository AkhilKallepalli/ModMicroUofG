# Zenodo Repositories 

Our research is currently distributed across Git and Zenodo repositories. While the Git repositories are accessible on [Github](https://github.com/AkhilKallepalli/ModMicroUofG), three repositories currently reside on Zenodo: 

- [**Biophotonics for All: Light Transport through Tissue**](https://zenodo.org/record/7876304)
- [**Pol-ModMicro**](https://zenodo.org/record/7837389)
- [**Modular light sources for microscopy and beyond (ModLight)**](https://zenodo.org/record/7385903)

## Biophotonics for All: Light transport through tissue

[Repository Access](https://zenodo.org/record/7876304)

This repository includes:

- Design files of electronics, mounts, LED Assembly (from ModLight) and LED mounts 
- Kit overview and LEDs assembly photographs 
- Demonstration Video of the Kit
- Bill of Materials

Biophotonics is becoming increasingly prominent in value and visibility. What was predominantly an advanced field of research is now being included increasingly in undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. To increase biophotonics-related STEM awareness, we developed simple and inexpensive LEDs and a camera set-up that allows visualising the blood vessels beneath the skin. The kit uses inexpensive blue, green, red and near-infrared LEDs to show the absorption of shorter wavelengths and transmission in the longer wavelengths in the finger. As an outreach and educational tool, this kit will illustrate the potential of using light for diagnostics.

## Polarised light modular microscopy (Pol-ModMicro) for identifying hemozoin crystals in Plasmodium

[Repository Access](https://zenodo.org/record/7837389)

In this repository, you will find all the files needed to recreate the Pol-ModMicro system. These include: 

- Unmodified OpenFlexure files; as used in the system. 
- Modified/Updated Components to allow ModLight integration
- OpenFlexure Nano Motor Controller files
- Bill of Materials

Plasmodium spp. are the protozoan parasites responsible for malaria. Plasmodium spp. synthesise a biocrystal, hemozoin, which can be observed under cross-polarised light. These birefringent crystals can be seen due to different refractive indices of the hemozoin crystal and red blood cells. Here, we present a polarised light modular microscopy (Pol-ModMicro) solution, complete with illumination sources and a robust imaging system to capture birefringence and identify the parasites. We achieve this by combining ModLight light sources with bespoke components designed for the OpenFlexure microscope to image blood smears. Further, a simple and robust algorithm capable of enhancing birefringence is presented. This solution provides image quality that is comparable to a substantially more expensive proprietary microscope.

## Modular Light Sources for Microscopy and Beyond (ModLight)

[Repository Access](https://zenodo.org/record/7385903)

***NOTE**: Files of the same version as on Zenodo and HardwareX paper availble through this [GitHub Folder](https://github.com/AkhilKallepalli/ModMicroUofG/tree/c88cae8ca496235c1b51023b1f2a8044d0d7d9a2/ModLight).* 

Modular light (ModLight) sources can be integrated into complex systems for microscopy, medical imaging, remote sensing, and so many more. Motivated by the need for affordable and open-access alternatives that are globally relevant, we have designed and shared light devices that use simple, off-the-shelf components. Red, green, blue, white and near-infrared LEDs are combined using mirrors and X-Cube prisms in novel devices. This modular nature allows portability and mounting flexibility. The ModLight suite can be used with any optical system that requires single- or multi-wavelength illumination such as bright-field and epifluorescence microscopes.
