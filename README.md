## **ModLight: Modular light sources** 

Modular light (ModLight) sources can be integrated into complex systems for microscopy, medical imaging, remote sensing, and so many more. Motivated by the need for affordable and open-access alternatives that are globally relevant, we have designed and shared light devices that use simple, off-the-shelf components. Red, green, blue, white and near-infrared LEDs are combined using mirrors and X-Cube prisms in novel devices. This modular nature allows portability and mounting flexibility. The ModLight suite can be used with any optical system that requires single- or multi-wavelength illumination such as bright-field and epifluorescence microscopes.

## **Phase 2: Epifluorescence Microscopy** 

...

### **Hardware** 
The original [OpenFlexure microscope](https://openflexure.org/) project provides a [basic microscope](https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/) and an advanced [Delta Stage](https://openflexure.org/projects/deltastage/) microscope, capable of achieving small scale control and high-resolution imaging. The imaging can be done using either Raspberry Pi cameras or any advanced, imaging cameras traditionally used in microscopy. 

Our contributions to this include a modified version of the epifluorescence setup to enhance access to the optics, introduce modular attachments and in-house built [ModLight](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ohx.2022.e00385) sources to increase the spectral fidelity of a single system. 

### **Sharpening Algorithm** 
Image prossessing techniques are an essential step in data analysis, especially so when the image quality is degraded. This paper presents an iterative sharpening algorithm designed for use on the OpenFlexure Microscope, to bring z-stack images back into focus. Three different sharpness metrics are evaluated and the data needed to process these images, and establish the highest quality after image acquisition is available [here](https://github.com/AkhilKallepalli/ModMicroUofG/tree/a79b8e51664f305bbde2d7f3cc1418ee8469735c/Phase%202%20(Epifluorescence%20Microscope)/Sharpening%20algorithm).
