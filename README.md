**Sharpening Algorithm:** Image prossessing techniques are an essential step in data analysis, especially so when the image quality is degraded. This paper presents an iterative sharpening algorithm designed for use on the OpenFlexure Microscope, to bring z-stack images back into focus. Three different sharpness metrics are evaluated and the data needed to process these images, and establish the highest quality after image acquisition is available [here](https://github.com/AkhilKallepalli/ModMicroUofG/tree/main/Sharpening%20algorithm). 

**Modified epifluorescence microscope:** The original [OpenFlexure microscope](https://openflexure.org/) project provides a [basic microscope](https://openflexure.org/projects/microscope/) and an advanced [Delta Stage](https://openflexure.org/projects/deltastage/) microscope, capable of achieving small scale control and high-resolution imaging. The imaging can be done using either Raspberry Pi cameras or any advanced, imaging cameras traditionally used in microscopy. 

Our contributions to this include a modified version of the epifluorescence setup to enhance access to the optics, introduce modular attachments and in-house built light sources to increase the spectral fidelity of a single system.
